# Unison.js Overview

**Unison.js** is a modern framework designed to seamlessly integrate signals with the React ecosystem, empowering developers to build faster, more efficient applications with less boilerplate and more business logic. It provides a smooth transition from traditional React components and hooks to a reactive, signal-based approach.

## Features

### 1. **Brings Signals to React**
Unison.js introduces the power of signals, offering a reactive and lightweight alternative to the React state model. Signals enable better reactivity, providing developers with an intuitive and fine-grained way to manage application state.

### 2. **One-Time Execution Context for Components**
By offering efficient one-time execution contexts for components and eliminating unnecessary boilerplate, Unison.js empowers developers to write more concise, maintainable code, improving productivity and reducing errors.

### 3. **Smooth bridge from React Ecosystem (Components and Hooks) to Signals**
Unison.js acts as a unisonjs between traditional React components/hooks and signals, allowing you to incrementally adopt signals in your app without a complete overhaul. This makes it easy to start using signals with minimal effort.

## Goals

### 1. **More Business Logic, Less Boilerplate**
By integrating signals and providing a one-time execution context, Unison.js reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write. This enables developers to focus more on business logic, improving maintainability and development speed.

### 2. **More Productivity, Less Footgun**
Unison.js aims to remove the typical friction and potential for bugs in React development. Developers can avoid the common pitfalls of working with state and reactivity, ensuring a smoother and more productive development experience.

### 3. **Centralized Optimization and Bug Fixes**
One of the core objective of Unison.js is centralized optimization. With this framework, many performance improvements and bug fixes are handled internally, meaning developers only need to upgrade to the latest version to benefit from these enhancements. This ensures that applications using Unison.js stay optimized with minimal effort.
